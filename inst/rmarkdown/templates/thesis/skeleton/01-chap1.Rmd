# Authoring with R Markdown {#rmd-basics}

_R Markdown_ is an extension of the [_markdown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. _R Markdown_ allows for the combination of R code, code output such as figures and tables and _markdown_ formatted text. This in turn allows for reproducible reporting.

The basics of _R Markdown_ are outlined [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). The book [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) provides a general overview of the full capabilities of _R Markdown_ while the `bookdown` package^[Upon which this template is based] and [its documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) provides details on authoring books with _R Markdown_.
