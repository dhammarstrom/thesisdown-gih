# Mathematics and Scientific notation {#math-sci}

It is possible to include mathematical notation in-line ($x_i - \bar(x)$) and as separate equations:

$$\hat{\sigma}^2=\frac{1}{N_1-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N_1} (X_{1i} -\bar{X}_1)^2 $$
\text{LaTeX} provides means to include and format such content. See e.g. [this resource](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for an overview of \text{LaTeX} symbols.
